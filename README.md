# regressions-eda

Think of this assignment as an exploratory data analysis that uses linear regression.Â 

Exploratory linear regression -- if you will.

We are building towards being able to pitch a story with linear regression. We will have some time to do this in the coming week or two. However, before we do that, you're going to want to do a bit of "night science" (or....night data journalism?). The goal is to explore a dataset using regressions, working towards a pitch, but without the pressure of needing to produce a pitch at the end of the assignment. You're just digging around and asking questions. 

* `regressions-eda-scratchpad.ipynb` should be your starting point, this is your "messy notebook". The teaching team won't look at it when reviewing your assignments, but it is where you should begin.

* `regressions-eda.ipynb` is your "clean notebook". It doesn't need to be clean like a final product, but it needs to be clean enough that the teaching team can read it and give you feedback on your approach. Please add markdown cells liberally where you explain what you are doing, and if you're looking for some feedback in particular, feel free to ask in the markdown cells. Additionally, please make sure your charts have axis labels and titles (the title can be a question or a short description). We're not as deep in the data as you are and we're jumping from one assignment to the next as we provide feedback, so please just make your thought process and variable names etc as clear as possible in this notebook. This notebook also has a section at the bottom with an ðŸ‘‰ for your thoughts on next steps. Please make sure you budget enough time to reflect on your work and write that section before you submit it.
